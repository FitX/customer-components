# useSort

This composable provides a way to sort data based on sorting options or a custom sort function.

The composable `useSort` exported here is taken directly from [GymX UI](https://gymx-ui-dev.fitx.de/?path=/docs/composables-usesort--docs) and is re-exported 1:1 without modification.
For detailed information on the functionality and usage of useToast, please refer to the official documentation of [GymX UI](https://gymx-ui-dev.fitx.de/).

Note: `useSort` is typically used together with tables.
