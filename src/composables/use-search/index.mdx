# useSearch

This composable provides a way to search through a collection of data.

The composable `useSearch` exported here is taken directly from [GymX UI](https://gymx-ui-dev.fitx.de/?path=/docs/composables-usesearch--docs) and is re-exported 1:1 without modification.
For detailed information on the functionality and usage of useToast, please refer to the official documentation of [GymX UI](https://gymx-ui-dev.fitx.de/).

Note: `useSearch` is typically used together with tables.
